I look into your eyes
and you're right here
with me

I ask you
How am I to you now?
I am looking for landmarks
a map to my love 

Only us
Remember this
all of me
is with you

We are held
by fire and friends

sea murmurs
stars bend

My messenger scrolling 
remembers meetings, touchings
reminds
I am a cloud gathered by mountains
formed and shaped and guided
I am trailing thousands 
of translucent threads
strands
ropes
reaching into homes,
islands,
storms
touching hands,
hearts
I pass through tempests
and under the sun

Aldous harding
You seduced me
into the black southern sunset sea
out on the point
on the barnacled rocks
surrounded by swirling waters 
as the slow tide drops
ocean rise
hypnotise
sadness and beauty
you soften my eyes
sighs of the ocean
wash around me
I slip into salty stillness
so smooth and inky 
 
Seaweed seaweed
caress me down
soft sea sing to me
so
Aldous,
Here is your princess (bay)
and there is your horizon
A dark dusking straight
reaches out
to a disappearing island

Yes Bandits
dark and beautiful
there were four
and they came four times
 
The first stole my friends
and left me silence
dewy grass under young feet
 
The second stole my home
and left me wandering
dusty foreign streets
a stranger
 
The third stole my love
and left me in a bare walled room
alone with a mirror
 
the fourth stole my plans
and left me
sleeping dreams

Oh my fine and long haired friend
Don’t ask why, or how it ends
just hold on and open wide
let all this moment
drop inside
 
And let it all
Go out again
Some to the trees
Some down the drain
 
Feel the love
And feel the pain
Feel the moon
Waxing and then wane
 
Feel the ocean
Between your toes
Quietly telling you
All it knows
 
Feel my hand
Our fingers mingling
Hear the made-up tune
We’re whistling
 
See the island
Under it’s clouds
Over the sea
Under the stars
 
See the sand
Stretching and yearning
Rippled by tides
Eternally turning
 
Feel the warmth
Of our kindled fire burning
Feel it touch your cold face
Yeah it’s learning
 
Learning to burn
Learning to talk
Learning to crackle
Learning to walk
Over the wet wood
Still full of river
Learning to lick
And to taste and to tinder
These once green and messy
Now smooth driftwood timbers
With their old ruru stories
In their old wooden fingers
 
Is it ready to roar?
Let’s help it along!
With a shout
And a howl
And a roar of our own!
 
Or does it just need
A little more coaxing?
 
Stick here
 
Twig there
 
Crafting a shrine,
Building a throne
For the night
For the fire
For all the unknowns
For the simple joy of weaving
These beautiful old tree bones
 
For the love of our rivers
Of their cold midnight stones
Singing through these mountains
With their hushed and soulful tones
 
For the love of the fungi
Unseen underneath
For the love of the seeds
Pushing up their first leaf
 
For the love of the firm ground
Under my feet
For the peaceful holding of
My internal retreat
 
For our mixing of breath
For our mixing of words
For our nuzzling of necks
For our both feeling heard
 
For our mixing of friends
And our mixing of rivers
For our joining of fires
And now for the sliver
 
Of morning light
 
The rising and falling
 
Waking and yawning
 
You nuzzle me
A morning kiss too
 
I’d like to share
Another day
With you.

Oh my beautiful
Daybreak sea
I’ve know you this morning
and you’ve known me
 
Now as I watch you
from my warm dry clothes
as the cloud swoops in
and the cold wind blows
 
I see your windswept face
and I feel your cold embrace
and my tongue still knows
your lively salty taste
 
of crabs and barnacles
Whales and seaweed
perhaps a hint of wastewater
from our humming factories
 
But I’ll take you as you are
and you’ll always love me
It’s ok, I know you love others too
trillions of creatures approximately
 
Darling you remind me
of this strong body
Thank you, my darling
my beautiful daybreak sea.

My hands are self-sown rocket
from Beka's garden bed
My heart is a navel orange
from Hastings, behind the collapsed old timber shed
 
My puku is a kumara
from the fields up Kapiti Coast
My eyes are two fine carrots
Ohakune's favourite boast
 
Sure these peanut thumbs came
from across the Tasman Sea
and I'm pretty sure these banana knees
weren't grown locally
 
But my legs are the rangy ram
that butted dad between his eyes
and my mind is all feijoa
grown sweet with spring sunrise
 
My toes are ten tomatos
from the fragrant vines in our glass house
and my arms are free-range eggs
that Nat found hidden in the grass
 
My blood is salad dressing
lemons thrown by the kids next door
We're made of this land
rain, sun, soil and sand
from our hair to our feet on the floor

Small waves
on smooth wet sand
pipe breaking fast
as their slop slips past

The sea here is smoother than elsewhere
Softer
A distant wheen of sunset bagpipes
The sea stills us

It's been a long year
I'm glad to be back here
This time with deeper friendship
a lot more love
a lot less fear

a lot more care
and gentleness
as we slowly prepare
for twelve more mad city months

I can't flourish alone
I need friendship and company
I need people to call home
Thank you so much for taking this journey with me

This morning I woke in fear
In the dream, I am in my home, far above Te Whanganui-a-Tara.
I look out the window at the blustered sunny sea
No whales today

I sit with an older man, ponytailed
He speaks wisdom to my heart
We carry the same knives

“Get out of bed, we’re moving the sheep”
The flock follows Dad out of the paddock, but one ewe splits off. 
Dad and I chase her, but she is wild and mad alone now. 
I am close to her. 

We both pause
looking at each other.

We both hear the flock

“maaa”

She turns and walks steadily,
we are following their voices
past the manuka creek,
out the gate,
across the stream

Later, I am alone on the farm.
I sit at the round macrocarpa dining table,
now scratched and marked like a school desk
ten thousand days with my family
recorded on it’s surface

I look out the big window
myriad greens in the afternoon sun
pond, filled with reeds and long grass
apple tree, cherry and rose
fence, paddock, the poisoned tan poplar tips
above the kowhai and mahoe lining the stream
behind them the bushed valley
and manuka ridge
whipped cream clouds 
and a baby blue sky

Serene Jones and Krista Tippet speak to me of grace

“Repentance — it’s a powerful word, as you said, and it really means, to walk in a different direction. It means to do it differently.“

A tui bomb-sweep bomb-sweeps across the valley

“I feel it like an earthquake underneath us — it feels to me like we’re in the middle of the Reformation. But people in the middle of the Reformation didn’t know it. It was only afterwards.”

a swallow swoops close to the window

“But what they knew in the moment, which is what we know, is, everything is falling apart.
Everything is falling apart, and something new is emerging.“

My body softens
I can feel the anger and confusion inside
transform into a sea of sadness
that gently fills me

tears come
